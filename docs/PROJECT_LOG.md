# Project Log

## 2025-08-25 â€“ Sprint 0: Repository bootstrap
- Created baseline Python project with `uv`, strict typing, linting, tests, CI workflow.
- Added state files (`PROJECT_STATE.json`, `PROJECT_LOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`).
- Implemented minimal CLI (`poke-pricer`) with `version`, `check`, `init`, `env`.
- Established ADR #0001 for architecture/tooling choices.
- Next: populate `docs/requirements/` with SRS/PRD/Architecture/Backtesting/Signals when pushing to GitHub.
